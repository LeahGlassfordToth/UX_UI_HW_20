            <h3>User Experience</h3>
            <p>Being in a sorority and kissing the Blarney Stone may have helped me build an ability to speak with just about anyone. In my project experience, collaborating on interview plans helped curate questions that were most appropriate and beneficial. I'm a strong believer in the idea that it isn't always about what is being said so much as how it is being conveyed. We all reference past experiences to create an understanding, and sometimes you just have to say the same thing in different words. It's something I practice often and use to improve my communication overall. My experience in customer service has made me more aware of the value of empathy and although research isn't my main focus, it is something I've enjoyed being part of in a team setting. Initial interviews, prior to any ideation, can provide such valuable feedback on what is needed. It's using this information to build on ideas and define user flow through a product that is especially exciting to me.

            <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
            <p>Combining empathy, functionality, and beautiful aesthetics is what I'm most interested in. Drawing on my background in graphic design, I've enjoyed the processes of defining the problem, ideating, creating a user flow, prototyping and testing for feedback and continued iterations. I have an understanding of business branding, voice, and implementing consistency across platforms. I've been part of developing social media content and strategy for several of my past roles. While never having input on store websites, I know how ease of use can affect people directly. In my retail experiences, I've been an extension of store website customer service. I do my best to provide solutions, workarounds, or to just lend an ear to hear about frustrations and take note of what trips people up on a store site. I believe my customer-facing retail experience and point of sale system use could provide unique insights to a UX/UI role and I look forward to exploring that further.

            <h3>Front End Development</h3>
            <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are completely different languages that take time to learn, of course. Although I've only had a couple experiences with code, I'm finding it much more enjoyable than years ago during my first attempt. I will not claim to be a developer, but rather as a designer with a special interest in coding and styling. Having built one single, simple design myself, I have a such an appreciation for those that build out everything we see online today. I've learned so much so quickly and have found that, for me, it takes time to sink in sometimes before making any sense at all. It has been comforting to have some ah-ha moments though! I think the biggest lesson learned is how to use available resources, e.g., Google, to help when things are confusing and to be grateful to work in a team where everyone brings their own skills and specialties.</p>
